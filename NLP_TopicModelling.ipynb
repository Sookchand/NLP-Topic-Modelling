Also, in both cases we see that the overal term frequency words were meaning full.  Hence the topics were pretty well harmnized and unique.  For example in my analysis we had words such as fuzzy, logic, expert, etc which are uniqure to the cluster.  Therefore the vector analsis looks correct.  Words such as go,and, is, etc which has no real value in cluster formation is excluded.  In the first Text analysis we see an overal term frequency of 5 words with the estimated term frequency with the topic being 3.  \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_dlrAbmPuk1_"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
