# NLP: Text Classification

This project is a text classification project using the 20 Newsgroups dataset. The goal of the project is to train a text classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes to classify text into four categories: alt.atheism, soc.religion.christian, comp.graphics, and sci.med.

## Lessons Learned

1. Exploring datasets is important to understand its contents and how to preprocess it for further analysis. 
2. It is important to understand how to use text feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF to transform text data into numerical feature vectors for machine learning algorithms.
3. Understanding the algorithms used for text classification, such as the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, is essential for good results.
4. Evaluating the performance of the model is crucial to ensure that it is working as expected.
